Features:

Turntable:

Frame Range Adjustment: Customize the start and end frame range to control the duration of the turntable animation. A smaller range results in a faster camera rotation around the object.
Radius/Distance Control: Adjust the size of the path along which the camera follows. A larger radius creates a longer path.
Height Adjustment: Modify the vertical translation of the camera path to achieve the desired perspective.
Create Turntable Around Selected Object: Select a geometry object in the viewport and generate the camera path around it.
Add Grid: Include a 500 x 500 grid in the scene for spatial reference.
Real-time Preview: Preview the camera path and its parameters in real-time. Make adjustments and preview again for instant updates.
